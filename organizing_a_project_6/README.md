### Question

In the United States, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration provides hourly XML feeds of conditions at 1,800 locations.[25] For example, the feed for a small airport close to where Iâ€™m writing this is at [http://w1.weather.gov/xml/current_obs/KDTO.xml](http://w1.weather.gov/xml/current_obs/KDTO.xml).

Write an application that fetches this data, parses it, and displays it in a nice format.

(Hint: You might not have to download a library to handle XML parsing.)
