Exercise StringsAndBinaries-2
=============================

```elixir

# Try the following in iex:
#
​#	​iex>​ [ ​'cat'​ | ​'dog'​ ]
​#	['cat',100,111,103]
# Why does iex print ’cat’ as a string, but ’dog’ as individual
# numbers?

# This happens because 'cat' is not an individual character, but a
# character list so the whole array is not a list of characters.


```
