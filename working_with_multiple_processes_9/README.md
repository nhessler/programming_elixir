Exercise WorkingWithMultipleProcesses-9
=======================================

### Question

Take this scheduler code and update it to let you run a function that finds the number of times the word “cat” appears in each file in a given directory. Run one server process per file. The function **File.ls!** returns the names of files in a directory, and **File.read!** reads the contents of a file as a binary. Can you write it as a more generalized scheduler?

Run your code on a directory with a reasonable number of files (maybe around 100) so you can experiment with the effects of concurrency.
