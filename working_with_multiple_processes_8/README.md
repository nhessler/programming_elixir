Exercise WorkingWithMultipleProcesses-8
=======================================

### Question

Run the Fibonacci code on your machine. Do you get comparable timings? If your machine has multiple cores and/or processors, do you see improvements in the timing as we increase the applicationâ€™s concurrency?


### Answer

seems like things decreased on 2 processes and 3 processes. But, things leveled out until we got to 6 processes where it then decreased again and leveled out for the remaining numbers. I assume there is something special happening at the OS/hardware level for 6 since I only have 2 cores.
